# Standalone Angular Tour of Heroes

This an accompanying repository to the blog post [Standalone Angular Tour Of Heroes](https://www.guido-flohr.net/standalone-angular-tour-of-heroes/) (German version: https://www.guido-flohr.net/angular-tour-of-heroes-als-standalone-app/). It shows how you can make the [Angular Tour of Heroes Tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes/toh-pt0) work when generated with Angular 17 and strict mode using standalone components without models.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `npx ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

The unit tests will not work, just as with the original tests.

## Running end-to-end tests

The e2e tests will not work, just as with the original tests.
